                    There’s no doubt that fiction has always been a great part of our lives. Humans are storytellers by nature. It was exactly through storytelling that we managed to form groups and share vital information with one another. We would, in the cage era, paint on walls and dance around the fire to bring alive and share our experiences. We would come up with fictional gods to explain mysterious events like rain or hunting luck.
Obviously, today’s fiction is far more complex and philosophical. The ways we tell and listen to these stories have changed too, and not necessarily for the better. The reading of fiction, something that has been our primary source for centuries, is not that favorable anymore: From 1982 to 2015 fiction reading has declined with more than 13% to make up around 43% of readers in America (defined as those who read at least one book

As a heart patient with ongoing chronic symptoms of coronary microvascular disease, I’ve been feeling distressingly awful lately. Usually this awfulness accompanies some other non-cardiac issue that dares to raise its ugly head, as if I actually needed ONE MORE THING!

This week, it’s been a lower back spasm, which is physiotherapist-speak for an ice pick jammed into my sacroiliac joint.

And my “normal” cardiac symptoms, particularly chest pain and a truly crushing sort of flu-like fatigue, seem to be happening more frequently in order to keep the ice pick company. And by the way, nobody tells you before you’re discharged from the hospital about the fatigue. . .
